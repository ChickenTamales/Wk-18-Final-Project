Final Project - HotSprings app.

There is a culture around hotsprings that the "right" way to do it is to skinny dip. For some hot springs pools there is a committed group of skinny dippers who regularly visit 
and clean these pools. In order for people to have the best experience it's important that we have a continually updated list of each hot spring and it's conditions. 

This app is meant for anyone to read and add to the many hot springs pools in the area in order to enhance experiences for visiters. It's especially important for safety reasons, 
as many springs can become dangerous if not properly taken care of, especially if they get too hot! With this app, everyone can contribute to the wellbeing of each hot spring
and it's visitors.
